<p>India’s External Affairs Minister Dr S. Jaishankar is an unusual combination of diplomat, 
    politician, and public intellectual. “The India Way” articulates his vision of India’s strategic choices.
     That he presently serves as India’s foreign minister makes the book an important
     primary document through which to understand the thinking of an influential architect of the country’s foreign 
     policy. Renowned political scientist Professor Christophe Jaffrelot reviews “The India Way” for SouthAsiaSource 
     (https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/category/blogs/southasiasource/).
    S. Jaishankar is today one of Narendra Modi’s most influential ministers. In a government team where the 
    number of ‘experts’ is very limited, he has a firm grasp on his subject: a career diplomat, he climbed all 
    the ranks of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, up to the supreme stage of Foreign Secretary – after having been
     ambassador in countries as important as China and the United States</p>
