    Norman Lewis was a grammarian and lexicographer from the United States who was widely
     recognized as one of the leading authorities on English language talents. Throughout his life,
      he published various books on language-related topics, including Roget’s New Pocket Thesaurus in 
      Dictionary Form and 30 Days to a More Powerful Vocabulary.
    Word Power Made Easy was initially published in 1949 and has been reprinted multiple times since then.
     In only the second phrase of the book, Norman Lewis says that the only thing you can do with a book 
     like Word Power Made Easy is to engage with it, to ‘speak aloud to it, talk back to it,’ to ‘use your voice,
      not just your eyes and mind
