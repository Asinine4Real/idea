            <p><li>Norman Lewis was a grammarian and lexicographer from the United States who was widely recognized as one of the leading <br>
                authorities on English language talents. Throughout his life, he published various books on language-related topics, including<br> 
                Roget’s New Pocket Thesaurus in Dictionary Form and 30 Days to a More Powerful Vocabulary.</li>
              <li> Word Power Made Easy was initially published in 1949 and has been reprinted multiple times since then. In only the second phrase<br>
                 of the book, Norman Lewis says that the only thing you can do with a book like Word Power Made Easy is to engage with it, to<br>
                  ‘speak aloud to it, talk back to it,’ to ‘use your voice, not just your eyes and mind</li>   </p>

    <li><h2> <a href="think.html"> Don't Beleive Everything You Think</a></h2>

               <ul>
           <p>    <li> If you don’t believe it, well, then you’re stuck with your false thoughts til you die and that’s that.</li>
              <li>   This means you’ll be at their mercy to make you miserable and do things that aren’t remotely in your best interest.</li>
             <li>    Sadly, you will think you’re a victim when you’re actually choosing to not develop and use the powers which will transform your life.</li>
              <li>  If you do believe that you can manage your thoughts, great.></li>
                 <li>That brings us to not believing everything you think.</li>
               <li>  If we don’t need to believe every thought that wanders across our minds, why do we?<br> 
                  The answer is that it has never occurred to most of us that we can put up borders to stop wandering thoughts from drifting or <br>
                  barging through the door to our mind and settling in.</li>
              <li>  I recall how I felt when I first learned that it was possible to manage our thinking and that all thoughts aren’t created equal—surprised and elated,<br> 
                like I was being given the keys to the kingdom.</li>
              <li>   Since then, I’ve seen clients experience this same transformative aha that they don’t have to be a slave to every idea that pops into their heads.</li>

              <ul>
              <li>  India’s External Affairs Minister Dr S. Jaishankar is an unusual combination of diplomat, politician, and public intellectual.</li>
               <li>  “The India Way” articulates his vision of India’s strategic choices.</li>
                <li> That he presently serves as India’s foreign minister makes the book an important primary document through which to understand the thinking of an<br>
                 influential architect of the country’s foreign policy.</li>
             <li>    Renowned political scientist Professor Christophe Jaffrelot reviews “The India Way” for <a href="(https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/category/blogs/southasiasource/)">SouthAsiaSource</a></li>
           <li>    S. Jaishankar is today one of Narendra Modi’s most influential ministers.</li>
            <li>     In a government team where the number of ‘experts’ is very limited, he has a firm grasp on his subject: a career diplomat, <br>
                 he climbed all the ranks of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, up to the supreme stage of Foreign Secretary – after having been ambassador<br>
                  in countries as important as China and the United States </li></p>
